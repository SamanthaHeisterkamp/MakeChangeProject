# MakeChangeProject
## Description
This program calculates change for a purchase by entering amount of item and amount tendered. 
## Technologies Used
I used methods, modulus, if statements, scanner, sysout statements, and casting. 
## What I Learned
I'm sure I went the hard way around a simple answer, but after getting in to the project, it really helped solidify using different methods multiple times that I was not previously confident in.
